x3PlateReader is an package that provides several functions that help
importing and pre-processing microplate reader data into R! Currently it
supports the output file generated by Perkin Elmer Victor x3, but
support for other file formats can be implemented in the future.

You can install the development version of x3PlateReader from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("viana-guilherme/x3PlateReader")
